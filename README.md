# Genetic-Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm which returns x and y co-ordinates at which the function f(x,y) gives maximum value.

Maximization of the "Peaks" function f( x,y ) using GENETIC ALGORITHM. f ( x , y ) = 3 ( 1-x )2e-x^2-( y+1 )^2 - 10( x/5 - x3 -y5)e-x^2-y^2- 1/3 ( e-( x+1)^2 -y^2 )

Genetic Algorithm:- A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search technique which is used in computing to find an exact or approximate solution to search and optimization of the problems.

Basic Steps involved :

1.Selection

2.Cross-over

3.Mutation
